# About
nhentai is an open source nhentai Discord bot powered by [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/).

##### Regarding `n!` commands : it's gone. Implementing `n!` commands require accessing each and every message's content (to respond when you call a command). For larger bots, this requires whitelisting from Discord's side - and they won't do that just for old-style commands to work, instead pushing people to use slash commands instead.

# Features
- Almost every basic features of the **[nhentai](https://nhentai.net/)** website.
- EXP system based on the number of doujins searched
- Follow a tag and receive a DM whenever a doujin with that tag is released
- Reverse image search using SauceNAO
- Random reddit post from [r/nhentai](https://www.reddit.com/r/nhentai/).
- SFW and NSFW images from [nekobot](https://nekobot.xyz/), [nekos.life](https://nekos.life/) and multiple booru sites such as Danbooru, Gelbooru, and much more.
- ASMR voice broadcast (experimental)
